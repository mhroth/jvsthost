JVstHost

JVstHost is an open-source Java-based VST host for Linux, OS X, and
Windows. It aims to load and manipulate all audio plugins conforming
to the Steinberg VST standard, including those generated with jVSTwRapper.

Note that the (only) constructor of JVstHost throws an exception of
type com.synthbot.audioplugin.vst.JVstLoadException. There are several 
things which may go wrong while loading a VST. For this reason, an exception 
is thrown with the details (see JVstLoadException.getMessage()). See PROGRAMMING API.

A class implementing the com.synthbot.audioplugin.vst.JVstHostListener
interface can also register itself with a JvstHost object. It will
receive callbacks from the plugin.

GETTING STARTED 
=== 
All that you really need is to put JVstHost.jar into your java class path, and to put:
* libjvsthost2.jnilib into /Library/Java/Extensions (Mac OS X)
* libjvsthost2.so into /usr/local/lib (Linux)
* jvsthost2.dll into C:\WINDOWS\system32 (Windows)
The directories may be system dependent. They must simply by listed in the Java classpath
so that Java will know where to look for them.

NOTE: Not all synths work. If you have one that you are particularly keen on
working with, please e-mail us and we'll debug it with you.


TESTING IT OUT
===
To run the test program:

java -jar JVstHost.jar <plugin name>

e.g. (LINUX)

java -jar JVstHost.jar ./mdaDX10.so

e.g. (MAC)

java -jar JVstHost.jar ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST/mda\ DX10.vst


jVSTwRapper 
===
http://jvstwrapper.sourceforge.net/ 

JVstHost does interoperate with jVSTwRapper. Ensure that the
jVSTsYstem.jar library (included with jVSTwRapper) is included in the
classpath when starting the host. In Mac OS X, this library is most
commonly found in the jVSTwRapper vst directory, ./Contents/Resources


COMPILATION
===
Mac OS X 
A script file, buildJvh.sh, is included for compiling the
JVstHost native library under Mac OS X. The script is made for 10.5,
however it should be easily modifiable for any other version of the
operating system. The script assumes that the Steinberg VST libraries
(not included in this distribution due to Steinberg's licensing terms)
are in the package subdirectory, ./vst2.x

The script will also copy the resulting library, libjvsthost2.jnilib,
to /Library/Java/Extensions.

Linux 
A script file, buildJvh_linux.sh, is included for compiling the
JVstHost native library under Linux. The script assumes that the
Steinberg VST libraries (not included in this distribution due to
Steinberg's licensing terms) are in the package subdirectory, ./vst2.x

Windows
Compiling the native library is unfortunately somewhat more complicated under Windows.
We use Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/) and MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/), and not
Visual Studio (it was hard enough for us to get a hold of a Windows machine to develop on,
let alone Visual Studio). Use the buildJvh_win.sh script.
 

Mac OS X / Linux

An ant build script is included to build and test the Java parts of JVstHost. to build the jar:

cd jvsthost
ant jar


PROGRAMMING API
===
There is a basic idiom to loading a VST, which is written below.

JVstHost2 vst;
try {
  vst = JVstHost2.newInstance(vstFile, SAMPLE_RATE, BLOCK_SIZE);
} catch (FileNotFoundException fnfe) {
  fnfe.printStackTrace(System.err);
} catch (JVstLoadException jvle) {
  jvle.printStackTrace(System.err);
}

This will return to you a fully initialised and operational vst. JVstHost2 does
not have a constructor. Use only the newInstance method.
